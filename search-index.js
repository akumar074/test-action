Prerequisites Ensure that the required dependencies are installed. Your Serverless Workflow application is ready to be built. For more information about creating your Serverless Workflow application, see Creating your first Serverless Workflow service. Quarkus CLI 2.9.1.Final is installed. Java 11+ is installed. Apache Maven 3.8.1 or later is installed. Latest version of Docker is installed. Alternatively, you can use Jib to build container images. However, Docker is required to build GraalVM native image using the Quarkus native builder image. Optionally, GraalVM 22.0.0.2 is installed. Quarkus provides a few extensions to build container images, such as Jib, docker, s2i, and buildpacks. For more information about the Quarkus extensions, see the Quarkus documentation. The examples in this document assume that you have the Quarkus tooling installed. For more information about the tooling, see Using Serverless Workflow tooling. To get started with building Serverless Workflow images, you can use the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application. Prerequisites Quarkus 2.9.1.Final is installed. You can skip the following procedure, if you already have a Serverless Workflow application. Procedure Clone the kogito-examples repository and navigate to the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application. Clone a Kogito example application $ git clone --branch stable https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples.git && cd kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus To run the example application, follow the instructions in Creating your first Serverless Workflow service. Install the Quarkus command line interface (CLI). For more information, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Add the required Quarkus extension using Quarkus CLI: Add the Jib extension $ quarkus extension add 'container-image-jib' After adding the Jib extension, if you see the pom.xml file, you can verify the newly added dependency: Verify the Jib extension io.quarkus quarkus-container-image-jib After installing the required tooling, you can start building your Serverless Workflow application. Prerequisites You have created a Quarkus project. Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, navigate to your Quarkus project. To build your Serverless Workflow application on Quarkus, run the following command: Build your Serverless Workflow application $ quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io The added Jib extension caches the target/lib directory. Based on the size of your project, Jib speeds up the rebuilds. If you want to push your Serverless Workflow application to a registry, ensure that define the following properties as required: quarkus.container-image.registry: To define the registry address, such as quay.io. quarkus.container-image.group: To define the registry. For example, context/namespace or in case of Kubernetes or OpenShift namespace/project. quarkus.container-image.push: To define whether or not to push an image. Set the value of this property to true. By default, this property is set as false. Example of pushing the built Serverless Workflow application to a registry $ quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true The previous command results in the following container image: quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 Alternatively, you can create an Apache Maven profile to build the container image, which can be triggered by setting the target profile. Example Apache Maven profile build-container true kogito serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.0 quay.io true You can activate the created Apache Maven profile using Quarkus CLI: Activate the Apache Maven profile $ quarkus build -- -Pbuild-container When it comes to Serverless Workflow, a small startup footprint is expected, which can be better when using the native builds to build a Serverless Workflow application. Prerequisites You have created a Quarkus project. Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, navigate to your Quarkus project. To build a native image, pass the --native flag using Quarkus CLI: Example of building a native image $ quarkus build --native -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0-native \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io \\ -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true The previous command results in the following container image: quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native In case GraalVM is not installed, you can set the quarkus.native.container-build=true system property, which creates a Linux executable. For more information about native builds, see the Quarkus documentation of Building a native executable. After building your Serveless Workflow image using Quarkus CLI, you can test the built image. Prerequisites Latest version of Docker is installed. Procedure When Docker is available, Quarkus pushes the container image to the local registry of Docker: Example JVM image $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 ... INFO [io.quarkus] (main) serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.22.1.Final on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.9.2.Final) started in 1.302s Example native image $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native ... INFO [io.quarkus] (main) serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.22.1.Final native (powered by Quarkus 2.9.2.Final) started in 0.039s You can notice that, the startup of native image is faster than the JVM image. To invoke the Serverless worflow application, execute the following command once the container has started: Example request $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{\"workflowdata\" : {\"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\"}}' http://localhost:8080/jsongreet Example response { \"id\": \"2acf710d-7e4a-481d-925c-dfd85a369987\", \"workflowdata\": { \"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\", \"greeting\": \"Hello from JSON Workflow, \" } } Deploying your Serverless Workflow application on Minikube Deploying your Serverless Workflow application on Kubernetes If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

Kogito supports the java and sysout custom types. The CNCF specification does not support java and sysout functions. Therefore, these functions might not be portable across other implementations. You can use the sysout function for debugging or for quick demonstrations as shown in the following example: Example of sysout function definition { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"printMessage\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"sysout\" } ] } In the state definition, you can call the same sysout function as shown in the following example: Example of a sysout function reference within a state { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"printMessage\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \".\" } } } ] } ] } You must avoid using the sysout function in a production environment since it can spam the unnecessary data in the application log. Kogito supports the java functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your Serverless Workflow service. The following example shows the declaration of a java function: Example of a java function declaration { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"myFunction\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod\" (3) } ] } 1 myFunction is the function name 2 custom is the function type 3 service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod is the Kogito custom operation definition. In the custom operation definition, service is the reserved operation keyword followed by the java keyword. com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass is the FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) of the interface or implementation class followed by the method name (myMethod). Your method interface must receive a Jackson’s JsonNode object and return either void or another JsonNode as shown in the following example: Example of a java function implementation public class MyInterfaceOrClass { public void myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) { // do whatever I want with the JsonNode: // { \"workflowdata\": {} } } public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) { // do whatever I want with the JsonNode: // { \"workflowdata\": {} } // return the modified content: return workflowData; } } To call the function shown in the previous example within your Serverless Workflow service, you can extract the required JSON value using jq expression or pass the JSON value without using arguments. In the following example, the caller sends the entire payload: Example of a java function reference within a state { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"callJavaFunctionAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\" } } ] } ] } Alternatively, you can pass the necessary data as shown in the following example: Example of a java function reference within a state passing the necessary data { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"callJavaFunctionAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"data\": \"${ .my.expression.to.data }\" } } } ] } ] } In the previous example, the JsonNode that the java function returns is the new payload in the Serverless Workflow execution. Avoid using java functions to call the external services, instead you can use the services orchestration features. CNCF Serverless Workflow Specification Understanding JQ Expressions.

For more information about these custom function types, see Custom functions for your Serverless Workflow service. Kogito supports events of the Workflow model as defined in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. However, correlation events has limited support. For more information about the events feature, see Event correlation with Serverless Workflows. Kogito supports the implementation of the data manipulation feature using jq (default) or jsonpath expressions. jsonpath expressions can have limitations in specific scenarios of complex data manipulation. For more information, see Workflow Data section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. Kogito also supports data filtering. For more information about the data filtering, see State data filters section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. Kogito supports jq or jsonpath to define the Serverless Workflow expressions. jq is the default expression language, however, if you want to use jsonpath, set the expressionLang attribute in the workflow definition as shown in the following example: Example of changing the default expression language { \"id\": \"myworkflow\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"expressionLang\": \"jsonpath\", \"name\": \"Workflow example\", \"description\": \"An example of how to use jsonpath expressions\" } jsonpath expression is not recommended because of the limitations of the language for data manipulation. Instead, you can use jq in various use cases. Kogito supports the error handling feature as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about error handling, see Serverless Workflow Error Handling. Kogito does not support Retries feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release. Alternatively, you can use Serverless Workflow Error Handling. Kogito does not support Timeouts feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release. Kogito supports workflow compensation as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about compensations, see Orchestration-based SAGA pattern. Kogito supports workflow constants as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. Kogito supports workflow secrets as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. Secrets are associated with the Quarkus Configuration module. This means that any form of configuration that Quarkus supports is also supported in Kogito.

This guide describes how to create a Serverless Workflow application that serves a hello_world endpoint. The workflow contains the following two states: Inject Hello World: Injects a Hello World message into the response Inject Mantra: Injects a Mantra message into the response Figure 1. Example Hello World workflow Prerequisites Java 11+ is installed with JAVA_HOME configured appropriately. Maven 3.8.1 Quarkus CLI 2.9.1.Final Visual Studio Code with Red Hat Java Extension and Red Hat Serverless Workflow Editor is installed to edit your workflows. For more information about the tooling and the required dependencies, see tooling guide. To create your Serverless Workflow service, first you need to bootstrap a project. Procedure In a command terminal, enter the following command to create a project: Create a project using Quarkus CLI quarkus create app \\ -x=kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow \\ -x=quarkus-container-image-jib \\ -x=quarkus-resteasy-jackson \\ -x=quarkus-smallrye-openapi \\ org.kie.kogito.examples:serverless-workflow-hello-world:1.0 The previous command creates a Maven Quarkus project in the serverless-workflow-hello-world directory containing the required Kogito dependencies, including: kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow: Adds support for Serverless Workflow quarkus-container-image-jib: Adds support for Container Image Builds quarkus-resteasy-jackson: Adds support for RESTEasy, which is required by the generated REST resources that are used to start the flow process using an HTTP request quarkus-smallrye-openapi: Adds support for Swagger documentation when you run the application in development mode The SwaggerUI is available at http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/ when you run the application. Create a project using Maven mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.9.1.Final:create \\ -DprojectGroupId=org.kie.kogito.examples \\ -DprojectArtifactId=serverless-workflow-hello-world \\ -Dextensions=\"kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow,quarkus-container-image-jib,quarkus-resteasy-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi\" cd serverless-workflow-hello-world In the previous command, org.kie.kogito.examples, serverless-workflow-hello-world, and 1.0 is group id, artifact id, and version of your project respectively. To verify that project is created, compile the project using the following command: Compile your project using Quarkus CLI quarkus build Compile your project using Maven mvn clean package After bootstrapping a project, you need to create a workflow. In the following procedure, a workflow named Hello World Workflow is created. Procedure Create a file named hello.sw.json in the src/main/resources directory with the following content: Example content for hello.sw.json file { \"id\": \"hello_world\", (1) \"version\": \"1.0\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"name\": \"Hello World Workflow\", \"description\": \"JSON based hello world workflow\", \"start\": \"Inject Hello World\", (3) \"states\": [ (2) { \"name\": \"Inject Hello World\", \"type\": \"inject\", (4) \"data\": { (5) \"greeting\": \"Hello World\" }, \"transition\": \"Inject Mantra\" (6) }, { \"name\": \"Inject Mantra\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" (7) }, \"end\": true (8) } ] } In the previous example: 1 id field is the unique identifier of the workflow. Kogito generates the REST endpoints based on this unique identifier. 2 states defines the states of the workflow. In the Hello World example, the workflow contains two states, such as Inject Hello World and Inject Mantra. 3 start field defines the state in which the workflow starts. 4 type defines the type of the state. In the previous example, the state is inject. The inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. 5 data defines the data that is injected into the state. In the previous example, greeting is injected with the Hello World value. 6 transition field defines the next state that will be reached after the current state is completed. 7 Injects a mantra with the value Serverless Workflow is awesome! into the workflow data. 8 end field defines that the current state is the end of the workflow. When the workflow reaches the end state, the workflow stops and the REST endpoint returns the workflow data, such as: Example workflow data { \"greeting\": \"Hello World\", \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" } The workflow definition follows the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification. For more information, see CNCF Serverless Workflow Specification Support. After creating a workflow, you can run your Serverless Workflow application.

Prerequisites Ensure that the required dependencies are installed. Your Serverless Workflow application is ready to be built. For more information about creating your Serverless Workflow application, see Creating your first Serverless Workflow service. Quarkus CLI 2.9.1.Final is installed. Java 11+ is installed. Apache Maven 3.8.1 or later is installed. Latest version of Docker is installed. Alternatively, you can use Jib to build container images. However, Docker is required to build GraalVM native image using the Quarkus native builder image. Optionally, GraalVM 22.0.0.2 is installed. Quarkus provides a few extensions to build container images, such as Jib, docker, s2i, and buildpacks. For more information about the Quarkus extensions, see the Quarkus documentation. The examples in this document assume that you have the Quarkus tooling installed. For more information about the tooling, see Using Serverless Workflow tooling. To get started with building Serverless Workflow images, you can use the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application. Prerequisites Quarkus 2.9.1.Final is installed. You can skip the following procedure, if you already have a Serverless Workflow application. Procedure Clone the kogito-examples repository and navigate to the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application. Clone a Kogito example application $ git clone --branch stable https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples.git && cd kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus To run the example application, follow the instructions in Creating your first Serverless Workflow service. Install the Quarkus command line interface (CLI). For more information, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Add the required Quarkus extension using Quarkus CLI: Add the Jib extension $ quarkus extension add 'container-image-jib' After adding the Jib extension, if you see the pom.xml file, you can verify the newly added dependency: Verify the Jib extension io.quarkus quarkus-container-image-jib After installing the required tooling, you can start building your Serverless Workflow application. Prerequisites You have created a Quarkus project. Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, navigate to your Quarkus project. To build your Serverless Workflow application on Quarkus, run the following command: Build your Serverless Workflow application $ quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io The added Jib extension caches the target/lib directory. Based on the size of your project, Jib speeds up the rebuilds. If you want to push your Serverless Workflow application to a registry, ensure that define the following properties as required: quarkus.container-image.registry: To define the registry address, such as quay.io. quarkus.container-image.group: To define the registry. For example, context/namespace or in case of Kubernetes or OpenShift namespace/project. quarkus.container-image.push: To define whether or not to push an image. Set the value of this property to true. By default, this property is set as false. Example of pushing the built Serverless Workflow application to a registry $ quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true The previous command results in the following container image: quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 Alternatively, you can create an Apache Maven profile to build the container image, which can be triggered by setting the target profile. Example Apache Maven profile build-container true kogito serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.0 quay.io true You can activate the created Apache Maven profile using Quarkus CLI: Activate the Apache Maven profile $ quarkus build -- -Pbuild-container When it comes to Serverless Workflow, a small startup footprint is expected, which can be better when using the native builds to build a Serverless Workflow application. Prerequisites You have created a Quarkus project. Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, navigate to your Quarkus project. To build a native image, pass the --native flag using Quarkus CLI: Example of building a native image $ quarkus build --native -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0-native \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io \\ -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true The previous command results in the following container image: quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native In case GraalVM is not installed, you can set the quarkus.native.container-build=true system property, which creates a Linux executable. For more information about native builds, see the Quarkus documentation of Building a native executable. After building your Serveless Workflow image using Quarkus CLI, you can test the built image. Prerequisites Latest version of Docker is installed. Procedure When Docker is available, Quarkus pushes the container image to the local registry of Docker: Example JVM image $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 ... INFO [io.quarkus] (main) serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.22.1.Final on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.9.2.Final) started in 1.302s Example native image $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native ... INFO [io.quarkus] (main) serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.22.1.Final native (powered by Quarkus 2.9.2.Final) started in 0.039s You can notice that, the startup of native image is faster than the JVM image. To invoke the Serverless worflow application, execute the following command once the container has started: Example request $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{\"workflowdata\" : {\"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\"}}' http://localhost:8080/jsongreet Example response { \"id\": \"2acf710d-7e4a-481d-925c-dfd85a369987\", \"workflowdata\": { \"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\", \"greeting\": \"Hello from JSON Workflow, \" } } Deploying your Serverless Workflow application on Minikube Deploying your Serverless Workflow application on Kubernetes If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

Kogito supports the java and sysout custom types. The CNCF specification does not support java and sysout functions. Therefore, these functions might not be portable across other implementations. You can use the sysout function for debugging or for quick demonstrations as shown in the following example: Example of sysout function definition { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"printMessage\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"sysout\" } ] } In the state definition, you can call the same sysout function as shown in the following example: Example of a sysout function reference within a state { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"printMessage\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \".\" } } } ] } ] } You must avoid using the sysout function in a production environment since it can spam the unnecessary data in the application log. Kogito supports the java functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your Serverless Workflow service. The following example shows the declaration of a java function: Example of a java function declaration { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"myFunction\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod\" (3) } ] } 1 myFunction is the function name 2 custom is the function type 3 service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod is the Kogito custom operation definition. In the custom operation definition, service is the reserved operation keyword followed by the java keyword. com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass is the FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) of the interface or implementation class followed by the method name (myMethod). Your method interface must receive a Jackson’s JsonNode object and return either void or another JsonNode as shown in the following example: Example of a java function implementation public class MyInterfaceOrClass { public void myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) { // do whatever I want with the JsonNode: // { \"workflowdata\": {} } } public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) { // do whatever I want with the JsonNode: // { \"workflowdata\": {} } // return the modified content: return workflowData; } } To call the function shown in the previous example within your Serverless Workflow service, you can extract the required JSON value using jq expression or pass the JSON value without using arguments. In the following example, the caller sends the entire payload: Example of a java function reference within a state { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"callJavaFunctionAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\" } } ] } ] } Alternatively, you can pass the necessary data as shown in the following example: Example of a java function reference within a state passing the necessary data { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"callJavaFunctionAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"data\": \"${ .my.expression.to.data }\" } } } ] } ] } In the previous example, the JsonNode that the java function returns is the new payload in the Serverless Workflow execution. Avoid using java functions to call the external services, instead you can use the services orchestration features. CNCF Serverless Workflow Specification Understanding JQ Expressions.

For more information about these custom function types, see Custom functions for your Serverless Workflow service. Kogito supports events of the Workflow model as defined in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. However, correlation events has limited support. For more information about the events feature, see Event correlation with Serverless Workflows. Kogito supports the implementation of the data manipulation feature using jq (default) or jsonpath expressions. jsonpath expressions can have limitations in specific scenarios of complex data manipulation. For more information, see Workflow Data section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. Kogito also supports data filtering. For more information about the data filtering, see State data filters section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. Kogito supports jq or jsonpath to define the Serverless Workflow expressions. jq is the default expression language, however, if you want to use jsonpath, set the expressionLang attribute in the workflow definition as shown in the following example: Example of changing the default expression language { \"id\": \"myworkflow\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"expressionLang\": \"jsonpath\", \"name\": \"Workflow example\", \"description\": \"An example of how to use jsonpath expressions\" } jsonpath expression is not recommended because of the limitations of the language for data manipulation. Instead, you can use jq in various use cases. Kogito supports the error handling feature as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about error handling, see Serverless Workflow Error Handling. Kogito does not support Retries feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release. Alternatively, you can use Serverless Workflow Error Handling. Kogito does not support Timeouts feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release. Kogito supports workflow compensation as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about compensations, see Orchestration-based SAGA pattern. Kogito supports workflow constants as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. Kogito supports workflow secrets as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. Secrets are associated with the Quarkus Configuration module. This means that any form of configuration that Quarkus supports is also supported in Kogito.

This guide describes how to create a Serverless Workflow application that serves a hello_world endpoint. The workflow contains the following two states: Inject Hello World: Injects a Hello World message into the response Inject Mantra: Injects a Mantra message into the response Figure 1. Example Hello World workflow Prerequisites Java 11+ is installed with JAVA_HOME configured appropriately. Maven 3.8.1 Quarkus CLI 2.9.1.Final Visual Studio Code with Red Hat Java Extension and Red Hat Serverless Workflow Editor is installed to edit your workflows. For more information about the tooling and the required dependencies, see tooling guide. To create your Serverless Workflow service, first you need to bootstrap a project. Procedure In a command terminal, enter the following command to create a project: Create a project using Quarkus CLI quarkus create app \\ -x=kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow \\ -x=quarkus-container-image-jib \\ -x=quarkus-resteasy-jackson \\ -x=quarkus-smallrye-openapi \\ org.kie.kogito.examples:serverless-workflow-hello-world:1.0 The previous command creates a Maven Quarkus project in the serverless-workflow-hello-world directory containing the required Kogito dependencies, including: kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow: Adds support for Serverless Workflow quarkus-container-image-jib: Adds support for Container Image Builds quarkus-resteasy-jackson: Adds support for RESTEasy, which is required by the generated REST resources that are used to start the flow process using an HTTP request quarkus-smallrye-openapi: Adds support for Swagger documentation when you run the application in development mode The SwaggerUI is available at http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/ when you run the application. Create a project using Maven mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.9.1.Final:create \\ -DprojectGroupId=org.kie.kogito.examples \\ -DprojectArtifactId=serverless-workflow-hello-world \\ -Dextensions=\"kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow,quarkus-container-image-jib,quarkus-resteasy-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi\" cd serverless-workflow-hello-world In the previous command, org.kie.kogito.examples, serverless-workflow-hello-world, and 1.0 is group id, artifact id, and version of your project respectively. To verify that project is created, compile the project using the following command: Compile your project using Quarkus CLI quarkus build Compile your project using Maven mvn clean package After bootstrapping a project, you need to create a workflow. In the following procedure, a workflow named Hello World Workflow is created. Procedure Create a file named hello.sw.json in the src/main/resources directory with the following content: Example content for hello.sw.json file { \"id\": \"hello_world\", (1) \"version\": \"1.0\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"name\": \"Hello World Workflow\", \"description\": \"JSON based hello world workflow\", \"start\": \"Inject Hello World\", (3) \"states\": [ (2) { \"name\": \"Inject Hello World\", \"type\": \"inject\", (4) \"data\": { (5) \"greeting\": \"Hello World\" }, \"transition\": \"Inject Mantra\" (6) }, { \"name\": \"Inject Mantra\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" (7) }, \"end\": true (8) } ] } In the previous example: 1 id field is the unique identifier of the workflow. Kogito generates the REST endpoints based on this unique identifier. 2 states defines the states of the workflow. In the Hello World example, the workflow contains two states, such as Inject Hello World and Inject Mantra. 3 start field defines the state in which the workflow starts. 4 type defines the type of the state. In the previous example, the state is inject. The inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. 5 data defines the data that is injected into the state. In the previous example, greeting is injected with the Hello World value. 6 transition field defines the next state that will be reached after the current state is completed. 7 Injects a mantra with the value Serverless Workflow is awesome! into the workflow data. 8 end field defines that the current state is the end of the workflow. When the workflow reaches the end state, the workflow stops and the REST endpoint returns the workflow data, such as: Example workflow data { \"greeting\": \"Hello World\", \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" } The workflow definition follows the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification. For more information, see CNCF Serverless Workflow Specification Support. After creating a workflow, you can run your Serverless Workflow application.
